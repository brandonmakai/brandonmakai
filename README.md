Come explore what I'm up to. I love to program and I write hundreds of lines of code on the daily! üòÅ

## Technical Work

- **Proficient Languages**
  - Languages: JavaScript, Python, Swift
  - Work in progress: Go
  
## Projects

- **Distrubted Task Queue, August 2024**
  - **Individual Project, (Go)**
  - Desperate to get out of the cycle of creating bad front-ends due to my lack of design skills, I am currently learning Go to make more preformant backends.
  - This project will serve as my first official intro to Go.
  - I plan on implementing Goroutines, HTTP networking, and more to better understand Go's paradigm.

- **Partner Analysis Intern Project, June 2024**
  - **Intern Project, (React + FastAPI)**
  - Really dove deep into learning backend logic, API calls, and systems architecturing.
  - Collected data on potential partners, wrote thousaunds of lines of code, and worked as the lead backend engineer.
  - Displayed data using ChartJS in React front-end.

- **SupaSonic LLM Web App, May 2024**
  - **Hackathon Project, (React + Flask)**
  - Learned basics of React from this project. Led to a new-found love for web application development.
  - My first "FullStack" application that I would say didn't just utilize a BaaS solution.
  - Learned basics of routing and API calls.
  - Learned how to implement OpenAI's API and basic prompt engineering (impressive, I know).

- **Solace, March 2024**
  - **Hackathon Project, (Swift)**
  - My first hackathon where I worked with a team.
  - Crash course on how to work with other members with no sleep and differing opinions.

- **Thrift, Feburary 2024**
  - **Individual Project, (Swift)**
  - My first passion project that I poured hundreds of hours into.
  - Smallish project created due to a recent interest in fashion at my university and watching the ever so inspiring "The Social Network" film.
  - The application allowed for students to login with their howard email and post about clothes that they had designed.
  - Learned basic data structures and algorithms to implement a matching algorithm (KNN).
  - First experience using backend technologies BaaS. Learned to dislike and recognize them as abstractions and you'll see my next projects used lower-level backend frameworks.
  - Learned the basics of data retrievel and image processing.

- **VideoPlayer, September 2023**
  - **Individual Project, (Swift)**
  - My introduction to Swift architecture and mobile devleopment. Started a phase of obsession with Swift (perhaps from being scarred by C++)
  - Custom iOS VideoPlayer app using UIKit and AVKit to play video content.
  - Implemented video file handling, error checking, playback functionality, and user permission requests.

- **SpaceBreak, May 2023 ‚Äì July 2023**
  - **Individual Project, (C++)**
  - My introduction to "real" programming.
  - Recreated the classic Asteroids game as CLI in C++.
  - Learned low-level fundamentals, problem solving, and collision detection.
  - Developed a captivating reinterpretation of the classic Asteroids
